# Exploratory-analysis-of-synthetic-customer-spending-data
This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic customer spending dataset. The goal is to understand how customer demographics and behavioral characteristics—such as age, annual income, and spending score—relate to one another and how they vary across different customer segments.
